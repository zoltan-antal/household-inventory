# Household Inventory Manager

This is a work-in-progress full-stack web app aimed at helping you keep track of your household consumable items efficiently. From groceries to toiletries, this app will simplify inventory management and shopping.

## Features:

- **Inventory management**: Keep track of your household consumables such as food and toiletries. Update quantities by scanning barcodes or manually adding/removing items.

- **Shopping aid**: Never forget what you have at home while shopping, making shopping trips more efficient and preventing duplicate or missed purchases.

- **Consumption rate based predictive shopping lists**:
  Over time, the app learns your consumption patterns and can predict when items will run out. Set your shopping frequency, and the app will generate shopping lists based on your choice of essential items to ensure you never run out of necessities.

- **Categorisation and labelling**: Efficiently organise items with extensive categorisation and labelling options. Avoid duplicate purchases by recognising similar items (e.g., different brands of ketchup).

- **Household collaboration**:
  Create a household and invite members. Everyone in the household can contribute to maintaining the inventory and benefit from accurate shopping lists.

- **Item rating**: Rate items to remember preferred products. This helps you choose the products you love when shopping for specific items.
